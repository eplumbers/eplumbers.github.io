<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has been in place since your home was developed so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a property owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared.

All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. This type of camera is specifically helpful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
