<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
