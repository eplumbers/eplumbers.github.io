<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
