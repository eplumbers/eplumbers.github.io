<p>Pipeline video inspection is a form of telepresence used to visually check the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to identify the condition of small size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
