<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to resolve the concern. Other times a more extensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>If it gradually drains away as you work, include more hot water. Keep plunging till the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a brand-new approach.

The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
