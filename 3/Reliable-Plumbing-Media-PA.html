<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
