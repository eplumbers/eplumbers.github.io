<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
