<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
