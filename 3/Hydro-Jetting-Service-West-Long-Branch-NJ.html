<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's smart to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
