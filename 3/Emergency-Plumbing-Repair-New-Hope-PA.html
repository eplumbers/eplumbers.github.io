<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange occur?

<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank.

Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
