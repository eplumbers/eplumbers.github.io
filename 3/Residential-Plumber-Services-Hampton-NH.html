It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>
