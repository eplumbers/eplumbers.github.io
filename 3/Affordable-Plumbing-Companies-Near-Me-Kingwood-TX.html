<p>The program achieves its objective by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and guidelines for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save cash. While this may work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system.
