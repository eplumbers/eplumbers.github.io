<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help ease those problems. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
