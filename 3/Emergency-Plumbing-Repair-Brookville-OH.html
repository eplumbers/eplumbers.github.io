<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
