<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of garbage does not need to enter the garbage can if it can easily and rapidly be dealt with through the sink.

By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent to land fills and other discarding areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>
