<h3>Water Softener Repair Installation in Whitestone New York</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
