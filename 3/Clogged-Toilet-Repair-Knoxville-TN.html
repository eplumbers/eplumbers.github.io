More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require changing the water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
