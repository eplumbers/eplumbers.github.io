<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might have to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are two standard piping materials used by plumbing specialists. PEX and copper both provide various advantages and advantages such as eliminating the metal taste from your water.</p>
