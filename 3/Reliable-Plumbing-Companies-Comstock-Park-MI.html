<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
