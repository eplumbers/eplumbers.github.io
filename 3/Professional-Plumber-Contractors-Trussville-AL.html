<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>The wage range noted here is based upon nationwide averages and includes all experience levels, from first-year apprentices through to highly experienced journeypersons. Wages can vary depending upon the agreement, company, place and collective arrangements (if relevant), as well as local and nationwide financial conditions. Overtime is not consisted of.</p>
