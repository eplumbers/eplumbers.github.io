When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
