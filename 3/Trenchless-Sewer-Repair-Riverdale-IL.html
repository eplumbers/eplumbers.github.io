<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
