<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
