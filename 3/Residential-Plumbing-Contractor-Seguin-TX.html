<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly.
