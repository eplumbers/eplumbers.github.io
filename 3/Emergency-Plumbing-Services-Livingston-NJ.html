Call your reliable Kent, WA plumbers at Fox Plumbing & Heating for quickly, quality service. Our top priority is you, and we intend to keep your house comfortable and safe.

Here's how simply one system can drastically enhance your water.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction result and draw potential pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are typically discovered in most homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
