<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Buffalo Grove IL</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
