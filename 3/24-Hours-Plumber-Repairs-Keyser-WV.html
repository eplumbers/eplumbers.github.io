As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>This may sound like a joke, but it's extremely serious if you wish to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.
