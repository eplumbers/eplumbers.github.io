<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
