<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Atchison KS</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
