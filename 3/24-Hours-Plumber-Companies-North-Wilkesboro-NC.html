<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of defense for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>At Beyer Plumbing, we'll strive to supply you with the professional, high-quality service you need. Our nearly three years of industry experience make us the wise choice for fixing your plumbing problems. Backflow preventers are needed in fire security systems by the 2018 edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code, the design code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Authorities (IAPMO) to promote the public's health, security, and well-being by governing the installation and inspection of plumbing systems.</p>
