As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
