<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
