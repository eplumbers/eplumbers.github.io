<p>The most efficient method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
