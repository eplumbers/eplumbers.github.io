Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can restrain the blades.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
