<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a consistent sewage smell in your home, it is essential that you contact a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can posture severe health risks.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your hot water heater really quickly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
