<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can select from a dizzying variety of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is usually a sign of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the clog isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can develop within the pipe, ultimately triggering it to burst.</p>
