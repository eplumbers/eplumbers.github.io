<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use a growing number of cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
