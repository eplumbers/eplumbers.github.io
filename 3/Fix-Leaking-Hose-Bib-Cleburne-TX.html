<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger issue to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is reasonably new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing among these products.</p>
