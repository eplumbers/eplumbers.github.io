<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
