The typical warm water tank will last for 8-12 years so repairs or replacement is something that you must anticipate to deal with a couple of times. When your water heater starts to leak, you have to install a new one fast. A clogged drain must never be taken lightly. If left unattended, a clogged drain can create more expensive damage. Call us today for instant service.</p>
