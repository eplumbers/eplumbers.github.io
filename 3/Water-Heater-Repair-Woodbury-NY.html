<p>Backpressure may happen when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
