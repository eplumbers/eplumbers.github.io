<p>Backflow is a prospective problem in a water system because it can spread out polluted water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any real or possible connection in between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or impurities to get in the potable water system.

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
