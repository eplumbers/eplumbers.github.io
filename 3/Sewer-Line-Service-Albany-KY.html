<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
