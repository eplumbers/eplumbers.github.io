<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there ought to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
