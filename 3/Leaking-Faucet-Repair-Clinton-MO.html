<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
