<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
