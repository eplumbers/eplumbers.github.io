<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
