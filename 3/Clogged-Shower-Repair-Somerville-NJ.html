<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
