<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
