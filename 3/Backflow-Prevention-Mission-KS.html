<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
