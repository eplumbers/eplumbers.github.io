<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
