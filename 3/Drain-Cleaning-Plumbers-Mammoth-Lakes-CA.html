<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
