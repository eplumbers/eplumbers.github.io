<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
