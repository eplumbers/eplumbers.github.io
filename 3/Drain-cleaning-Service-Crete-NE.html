<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines.

Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and long lasting  choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be gotten rid of and your pipe will be inspected one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
