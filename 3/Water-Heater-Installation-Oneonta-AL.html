<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
