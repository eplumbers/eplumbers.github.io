<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
