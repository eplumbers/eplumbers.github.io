Sediment Build-Up: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Lacking warm water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
