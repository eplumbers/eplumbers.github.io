Backflow is the turnaround of the flow of water in the plumbing system. It can happen when the pressure in the water main or a house's plumbing system changes. You have a clog in the drain line somewhere if your toilet is overflowing. The first step would be to clear the clog which you may need a professional plumber for.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to schedule annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you understand that you have a history of obstructing or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the outcomes to us.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
