<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>We have 2 no-dig methods to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We complete CIPP repairs with no excavation. Pipe breaking requires limited digging. Both techniques are ending up being more popular with our customers, but many people aren't knowledgeable about these trenchless techniques.
