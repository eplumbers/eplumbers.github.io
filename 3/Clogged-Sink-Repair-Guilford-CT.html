Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
