<p>One typical way for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private houses, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger normal circulation to reverse, backpressure takes place. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
