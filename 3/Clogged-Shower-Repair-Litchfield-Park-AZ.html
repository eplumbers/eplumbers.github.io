<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
