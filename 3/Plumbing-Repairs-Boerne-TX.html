When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
