<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
