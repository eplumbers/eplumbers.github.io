Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be supplied.</p>
