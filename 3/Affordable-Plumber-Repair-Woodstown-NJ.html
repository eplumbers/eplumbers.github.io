<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you must just hire a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it does not enter the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
