If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper safety measures.</p>
