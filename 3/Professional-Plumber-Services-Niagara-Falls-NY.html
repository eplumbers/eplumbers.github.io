<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Niagara Falls NY</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>The cost to repipe a house with PEX tubing is $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot depending on the size of the house and the level of replumbing you're doing. Repiping a 2,000 square foot house with PEX costs in between $2,000 and $4,000. PEX is plastic tubing or hose with lots of beneficial characteristics. However, PEX has actually only been used for about a decade, and any health risks of using plastic water system lines are unidentified.</p>
