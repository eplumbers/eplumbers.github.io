Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

Depending on the severity of the scenario, only one piece might need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly must be eliminated and replaced. Elements involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
