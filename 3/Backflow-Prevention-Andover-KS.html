<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Many folks replace their water heaters due to poor performance, complete failure or as a preventive procedure.

<p>Unexpected modifications in water pressure could possibly be because of deterioration and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.

Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
