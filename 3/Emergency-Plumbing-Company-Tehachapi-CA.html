<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
