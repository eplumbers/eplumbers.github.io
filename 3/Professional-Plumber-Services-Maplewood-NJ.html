<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
