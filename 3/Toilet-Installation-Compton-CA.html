<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>There are certain plumbers who specialize in plumbing related to home remodeling and brand-new building and construction. When a new house is built, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be a great prospect for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber must be used for home renovating work.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
