<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
