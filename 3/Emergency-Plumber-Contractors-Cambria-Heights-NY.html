<p>One typical way for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
