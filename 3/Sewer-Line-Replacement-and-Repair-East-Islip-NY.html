<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at completion of its lifespan, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
