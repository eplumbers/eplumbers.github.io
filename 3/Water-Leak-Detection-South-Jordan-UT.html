<p>A plumbing floor plan (plan view) or partial layout indicating water services, name and address of facility, water meter design, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all neighboring items (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, etc.). The plan must be drawn to scale or with measurements indicated from walls and all close-by items.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
