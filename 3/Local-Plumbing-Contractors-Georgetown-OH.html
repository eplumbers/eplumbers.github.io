<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
