<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
