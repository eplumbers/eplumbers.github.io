<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy much healthier skin and hair.
