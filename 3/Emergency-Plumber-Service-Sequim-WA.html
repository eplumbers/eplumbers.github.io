<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence used to aesthetically examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to identify the condition of little size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>Turn the handle counterclockwise if it becomes difficult to turn; it's likely you have actually encountered a clog. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Insert it back into the drain up until you hit resistance once again, then turn the manage back and forth to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out regularly to remove particles until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
