Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
