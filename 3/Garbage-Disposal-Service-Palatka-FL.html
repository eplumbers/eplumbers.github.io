<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Palatka</h2>

<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.

<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Palatka FL</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
