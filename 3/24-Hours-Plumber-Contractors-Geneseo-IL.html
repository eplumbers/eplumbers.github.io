<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

It is very important that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
