<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
