<p>The most effective method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
