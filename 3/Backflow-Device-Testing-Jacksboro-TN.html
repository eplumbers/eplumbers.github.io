<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based upon a variety of claims concerning their impact on water hardness and associated scale development.

<p>Plumbing has a big influence on the comfort and security inside any home. Systems with clogged, dirty pipes can lead to a range of plumbing problems.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
