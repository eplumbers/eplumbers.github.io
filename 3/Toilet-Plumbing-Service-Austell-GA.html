<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get rusty or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down effectively. It's an easy repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush manage out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Photo 1). Then remove the old handle and lever, slide the new manage into location, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, anybody who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need a license and inspection.</p>
