<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
