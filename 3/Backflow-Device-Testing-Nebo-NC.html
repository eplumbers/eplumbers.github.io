Which is why selecting a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally important. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically developed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and might eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
