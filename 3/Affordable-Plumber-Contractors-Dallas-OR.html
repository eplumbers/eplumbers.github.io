When tree roots begin to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the task potentially dangerous. That makes it a great factor to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Property owners can either buy the new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>

The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
