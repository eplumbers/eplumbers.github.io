<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
