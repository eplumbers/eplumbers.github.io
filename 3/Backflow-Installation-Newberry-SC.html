<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to provide years of security. There are lots of regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
