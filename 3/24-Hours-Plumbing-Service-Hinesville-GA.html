With toilets, the pro will examine water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. She or he will eyeball noticeable pipes, and might run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the within.</p>

However, tough water can cause everything from small annoyances, like areas on dishes or soap residue, to significant problems like a much shorter life-span for your water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be a helpful investment for your home.</p>
