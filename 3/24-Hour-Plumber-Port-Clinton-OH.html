<p>New shower drains create strong seals that are less most likely to loosen up in time. Several choices are terrific for tight areas and permit fast installation.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
