DO use lots of water each time you grind up food residue, and keep water running for a few seconds after the disposal is done. When you're all set to actually install your waste disposal unit, follow these steps listed below thanks to Lowe's job specialist, Hunter Macfarlane.

<p>With time that ground settles and when it does you run the extremely real threat of the sewer line shearing at the foundation wall. The piping drops and a blockage takes place.

Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
