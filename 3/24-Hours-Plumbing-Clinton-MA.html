<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with hard water, you might not realize just how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
