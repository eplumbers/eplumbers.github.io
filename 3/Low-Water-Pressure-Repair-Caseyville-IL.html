<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you see unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
