<p>Backflow is a potential issue in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread polluted water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or real connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable contaminants or contaminants to enter the drinkable water system. Illness can result from consuming water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
