<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can become rusty and worn, resulting in leaks. Depending upon the seriousness of the situation, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and changed. Components involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
