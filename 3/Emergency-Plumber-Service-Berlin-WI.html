<p>Do you observe that you have flaky or dry skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? As people and companies all throughout Washington take extraordinary measures to secure against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and comply with the Stay at home, Stay Healthy" order, we understand that your home plumbing and heating unit still need repairs, especially as they're used more than ever with additional hours in the house. Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets.

This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then go into the potable water supply. The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year.
