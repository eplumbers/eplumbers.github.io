It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly working RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>

<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
