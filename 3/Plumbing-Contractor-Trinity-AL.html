<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
