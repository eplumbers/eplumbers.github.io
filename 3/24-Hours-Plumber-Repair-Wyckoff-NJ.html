<p>We suggest that property owners buy cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber a minimum of once each year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running efficiently.

In some cases whatever is obstructing the drain will not budge. It may be time to call a professional plumber if you've tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can determine the area of the blockage and the best ways to unclog the traffic jam without damaging your plumbing.</p>
