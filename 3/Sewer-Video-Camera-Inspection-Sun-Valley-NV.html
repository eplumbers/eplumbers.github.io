<h3>Heating And Plumbing Service in Sun Valley Nevada</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated if the tap is instantly changed off. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to suit your preferences and needs. Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
