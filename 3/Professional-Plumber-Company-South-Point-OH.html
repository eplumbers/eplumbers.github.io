<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential problem with the water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy rust buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could imply that there have been fluctuations in pressure triggering small leaks.</p>
