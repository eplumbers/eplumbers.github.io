<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Candler NC 28715</h3>
<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with hard water, you might not recognize how much it affects you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
