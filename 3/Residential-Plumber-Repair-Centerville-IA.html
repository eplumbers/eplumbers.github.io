<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale formation in hard water systems. It is extremely hard to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based on tests that are well enough explained to allow others to examine them and to verify the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it must make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately preserved. Making certain the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
