<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Prospect CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
