<p>Purchasing a home is a huge financial investment. Knowing if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be convenient when negotiating the sale of a house. There are numerous types of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get an entire home plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
