Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas.

<p>When the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly.
