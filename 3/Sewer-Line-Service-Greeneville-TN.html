Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
