<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building permit is generally required before a plumbing authorization can be released. Soften just what you need to. Individuals typically pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be connected to a softener. In many cases, people select to soften just the warm water.</p>

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

Indications of deterioration or scale buildup on fixtures might suggest past leaks and high pressure. If there is a bigger problem requiring attention, this can lead plumbers to investigate.
