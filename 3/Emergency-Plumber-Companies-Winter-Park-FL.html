<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and obligation are incredibly important to constructing a reputation for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed.
