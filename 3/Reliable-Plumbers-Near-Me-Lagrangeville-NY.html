<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician switched off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers available that you might encounter. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
