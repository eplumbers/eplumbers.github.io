<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
