<p>When figuring out the solidity of water, there are ranges of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is thought about incredibly hard water, leaving indications like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to eliminate. With well water, these symptoms may also be paired with iron stains and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
