<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with hard water, you may not realize how much it impacts you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
