<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid normally will help remove them if you have rust spots. If you wish to try the gentlest method perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety cautions first!).

Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
