<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
