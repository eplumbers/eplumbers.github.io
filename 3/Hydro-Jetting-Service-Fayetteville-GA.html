Garbage disposals are pretty simple to keep. The most crucial thing to remember is that they are actually food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage needs to not be positioned in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
