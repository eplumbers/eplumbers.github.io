<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
