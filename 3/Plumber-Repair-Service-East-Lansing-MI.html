<p>If a cable has actually not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer at any time ahead of time, signing up with the cable to the wires in package just before or simply after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty simple to keep. The most crucial thing to keep in mind is that they are really food disposals.

<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You may need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
