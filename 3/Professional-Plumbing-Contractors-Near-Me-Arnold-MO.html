<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
