<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
