Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
