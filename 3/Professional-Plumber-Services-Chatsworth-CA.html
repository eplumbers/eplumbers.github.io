<p>You are accountable for replacing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly should satisfy the lead totally free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be stopped till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
