<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
