<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow.
