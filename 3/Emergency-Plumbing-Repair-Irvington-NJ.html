<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is utilized to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Co2 will possibly add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
