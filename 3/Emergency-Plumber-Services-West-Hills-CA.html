<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
