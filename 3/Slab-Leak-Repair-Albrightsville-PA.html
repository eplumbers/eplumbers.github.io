<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and circulation pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely utilized today for new building residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also very long lasting and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly used pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
