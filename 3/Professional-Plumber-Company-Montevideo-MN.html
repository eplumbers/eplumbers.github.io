<p>A typical whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days, depending on the size of the home, how many levels it has and the chosen pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, entirely replace the pipes, re-install the removed drywall and spot it to eliminate any signs of damage or change to your house.</p>
<p>One common way for a house's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in individual residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
