<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
