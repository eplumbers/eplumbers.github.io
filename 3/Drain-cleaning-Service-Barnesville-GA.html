<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification.

<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Copper piping and PEX piping are used because of their cost, safety and effectiveness. Copper piping avoids germs from growing within the pipe supplying healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both flexible and lightweight. This material is resistant against corrosion and will help enhance water pressure.</p>
<p>Hard water triggers a greater threat of lime scale deposits in household water supply. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is lowered. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes against the # 1 check and likewise fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
