<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop.

This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
