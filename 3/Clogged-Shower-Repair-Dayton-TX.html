<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Dayton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation. You count on your hot water heater every day for all the warm water you and your family need to cook, clean, and shower.

<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
