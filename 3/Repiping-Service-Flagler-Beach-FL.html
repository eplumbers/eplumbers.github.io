<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of garbage does not need to enter the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be gotten rid of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
