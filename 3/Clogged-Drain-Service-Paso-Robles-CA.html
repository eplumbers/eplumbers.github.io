<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
