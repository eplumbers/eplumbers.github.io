<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
