<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>
