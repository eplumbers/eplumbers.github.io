<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
