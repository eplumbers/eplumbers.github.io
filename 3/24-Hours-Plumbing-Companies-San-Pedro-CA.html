<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Checking the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak somewhere and this could be severe problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house must have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working properly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.
