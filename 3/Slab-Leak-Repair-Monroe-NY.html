The resin is offered a few hours to totally harden and treat, and after the sewer pipe line repair procedure is completed, our clients are provided with a new sewer line that will contribute to the general quality of the sewer system for many years. Expected to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are designed to be efficient and durable, withstanding deterioration and other typical problems that can afflict other pipeline material types.</p>
