<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you ought to wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
