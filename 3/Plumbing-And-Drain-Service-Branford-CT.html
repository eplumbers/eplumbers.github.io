<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a personal water supply surpasses the pressure in the general public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>
