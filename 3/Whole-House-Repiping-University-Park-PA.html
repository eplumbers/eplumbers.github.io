<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at University Park PA 16802</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl).

Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
