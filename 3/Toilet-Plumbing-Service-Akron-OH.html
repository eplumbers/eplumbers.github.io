<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest technique maybe try using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the instructions and safety warnings initially!).

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
