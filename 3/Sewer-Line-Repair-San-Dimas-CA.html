Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
