The pipe is, after all, something of a fundamental building block of any plumbing system.

<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
