<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water system. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
