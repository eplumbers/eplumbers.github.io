<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
