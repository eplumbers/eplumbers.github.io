<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are specific impurities that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those concerns. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
