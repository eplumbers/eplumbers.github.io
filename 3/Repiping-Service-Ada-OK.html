<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you utilize PEX, copper, or another product.

As time moves on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>

This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
