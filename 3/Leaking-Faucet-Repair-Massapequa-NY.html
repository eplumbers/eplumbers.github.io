<h3>Drain Cleaning in Massapequa New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
