<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Barboursville WV</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely rare cases where the building is deemed to not posture a danger to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
