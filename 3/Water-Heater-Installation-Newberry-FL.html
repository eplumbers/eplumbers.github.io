Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
