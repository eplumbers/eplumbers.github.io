Some property owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, particularly if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are usually short-lived fixes that do not use long-term resolutions.</p>
