<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a safe and steady  location.

You need to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also inspect to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
