If your sewer lines are below trees, near extensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a good deal of civilian casualties (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
