<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Laguna Hills CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
