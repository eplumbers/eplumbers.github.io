<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
