<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
