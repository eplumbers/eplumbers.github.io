<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
