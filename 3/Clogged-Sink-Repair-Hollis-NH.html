<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Hollis</h2>

<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, color, taste or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may require changing the water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
