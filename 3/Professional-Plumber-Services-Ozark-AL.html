<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the option is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the issue. Other times a more comprehensive option is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply years of defense. There are lots of local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
