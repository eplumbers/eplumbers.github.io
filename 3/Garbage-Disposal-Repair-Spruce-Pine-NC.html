It might be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed correctly.

That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

<p>The excellent news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your whole unit if you suspect your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
