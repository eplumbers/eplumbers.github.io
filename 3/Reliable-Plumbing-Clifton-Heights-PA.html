When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
