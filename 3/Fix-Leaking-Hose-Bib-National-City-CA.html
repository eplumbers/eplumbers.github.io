<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services National City CA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly unusual cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
