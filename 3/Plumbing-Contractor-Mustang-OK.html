<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is fairly short. Soft or crisp foods are fine, but tough or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the typical kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties.

<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
