<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you do not get that chance.

Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits.

<p>Think about all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional evaluation ought to cover.
