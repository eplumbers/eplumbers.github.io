If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
