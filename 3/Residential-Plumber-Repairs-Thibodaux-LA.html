As hard water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

Homes built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve becomes part of the system for that specific reason. However while small drips ought to not be cause for issue, homeowners must watch on the water heater leaks. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He also finished the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less expensive than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
