<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, prepare for each device to be set up should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Declined strategies need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>
