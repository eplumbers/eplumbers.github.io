The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not go into the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when utilized in fighting a fire. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lower extent their residential or commercial property.
