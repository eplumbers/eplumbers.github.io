<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture wetness so that it does not get in the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must meet or exceed the state standards and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
