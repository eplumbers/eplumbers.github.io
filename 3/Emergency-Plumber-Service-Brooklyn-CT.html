But the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
