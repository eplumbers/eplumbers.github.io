The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not get in the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>

We offer a variety of highly effective and affordable systems, and offer upfront pricing before work starts so there are not a surprises.
