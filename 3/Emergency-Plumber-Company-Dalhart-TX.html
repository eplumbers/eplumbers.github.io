Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
