When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to discover gurgling noises, water supporting into your sink or shower, or strange smells.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
