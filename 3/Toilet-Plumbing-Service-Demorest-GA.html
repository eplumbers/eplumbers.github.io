Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
