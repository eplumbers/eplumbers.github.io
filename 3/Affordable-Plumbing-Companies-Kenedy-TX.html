<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
