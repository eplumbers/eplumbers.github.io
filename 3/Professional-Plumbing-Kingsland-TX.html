Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration, demand that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
