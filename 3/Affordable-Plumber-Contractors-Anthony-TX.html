This repair approach is generally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>

Many scattering systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be evaluated each year. Others might not fulfill state and local policies and may need to be changed with the correct backflow preventer.</p>

Because a 2nd inspection isn't required, it also conserves you cash and time.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is usually on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank.
