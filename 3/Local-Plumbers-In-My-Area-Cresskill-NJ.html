Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in some cases, consist of phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
