The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.

<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
