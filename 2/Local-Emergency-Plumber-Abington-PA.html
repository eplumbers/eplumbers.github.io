<p>Prior to the repair service technician starts the repair process, he needs to make certain he has actually examined the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any restrictive conditions. If the area is considered a restricted space, correct safety precautions must be followed for correct entry. A proper and safe  workplace may involve the positioning of security barricades or entry constraints around the work area so the repair specialist or the public around your work area are not harmed.
