<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
