<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
