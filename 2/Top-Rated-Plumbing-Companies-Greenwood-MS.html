<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically detected before it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to continuously leak out really slowly. Gradually it can lead to a considerable build of water.
