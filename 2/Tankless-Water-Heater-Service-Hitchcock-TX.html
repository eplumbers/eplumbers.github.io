<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it instantly becomes a severe security hazard. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it could trigger a fair bit of damage if the gas inside ends up being sparked. If a person understands that they have actually burst a gas line, the very first priority is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company.</p>
<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl.

Water will not drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.
