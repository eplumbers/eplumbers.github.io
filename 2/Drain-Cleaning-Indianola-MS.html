<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.

Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating corrosion Co2 will potentially contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, therefore making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
