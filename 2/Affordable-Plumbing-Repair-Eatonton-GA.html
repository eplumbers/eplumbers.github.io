For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
