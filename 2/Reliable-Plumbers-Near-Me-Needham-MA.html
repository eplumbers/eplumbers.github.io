<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical form it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this setup the loop should be greater than 33 feet to work appropriately. When designed by doing this it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system.
