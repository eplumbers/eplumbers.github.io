<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with garbage disposal installation make the task potentially hazardous. That makes it a terrific reason to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Property owners can either acquire the brand-new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the general cost.</p>

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
