<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Robinson IL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
