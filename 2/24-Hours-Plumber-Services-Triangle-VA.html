<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
