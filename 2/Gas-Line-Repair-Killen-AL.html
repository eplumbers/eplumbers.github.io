It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.
