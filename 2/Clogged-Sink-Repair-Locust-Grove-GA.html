Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Numerous houses in my community being repiped and have talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't found quickly, apparently it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage.</p>
