<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts.

Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Even professional plumbers often try 2 or three flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
