<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
