<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
