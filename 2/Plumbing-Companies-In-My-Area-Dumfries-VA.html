<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
