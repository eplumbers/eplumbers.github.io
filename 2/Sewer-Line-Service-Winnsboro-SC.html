<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
