<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
