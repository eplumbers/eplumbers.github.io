<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
