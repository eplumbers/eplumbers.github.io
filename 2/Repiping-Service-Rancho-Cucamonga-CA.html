<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
