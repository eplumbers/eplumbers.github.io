<p>Numerous homeowners believe their energy companies or homeowners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. Most standard property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
