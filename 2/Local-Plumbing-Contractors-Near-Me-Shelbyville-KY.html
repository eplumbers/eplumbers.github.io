<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Shelbyville KY</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can pick from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is normally a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can develop within the pipe, ultimately triggering it to burst.</p>
