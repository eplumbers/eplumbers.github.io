<p>Backpressure might take place when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping.

Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly secured.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
