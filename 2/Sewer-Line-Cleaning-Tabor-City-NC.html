<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
