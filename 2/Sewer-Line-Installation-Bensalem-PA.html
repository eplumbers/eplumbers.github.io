<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
