<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
