<p>If you discover yourself constantly jiggling the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to hire among our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in finding the leak or broken element and fixing it. Grease: Never pour grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of washing away, these products frequently harden to form nasty blockages, which you may need a plumber to remove.</p>
