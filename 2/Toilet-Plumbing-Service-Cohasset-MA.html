<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
