<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Obstructions that continue after you have actually tried to repair them call for professional support. Continued attempts on your own can hurt your lines, and you may have a more severe underlying problem than you understand.
