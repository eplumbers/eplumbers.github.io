<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
