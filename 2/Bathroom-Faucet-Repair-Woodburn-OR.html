<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house.

Plumbers also assist preserve septic systems-- large, underground holding tanks that collect waste from homes that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>The Battelle Research study also discovered difficult water to rapidly cause clogged shower heads, sometimes after as low as a year and a half of routine use. After simply one week of constant testing with tough water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to lab outcomes. Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, meanwhile, carried out almost as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
