<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain since they typically consist of grease and fat.
