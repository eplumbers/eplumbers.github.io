Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items including extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
