This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking.
