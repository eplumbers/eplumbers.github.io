<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
