<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Tank hot water heater are the most typical, and are run with gas. Their style consists of an insulated tank where water is warmed and kept till needed. Gas water heaters are more energy effective and operating expense are minimized by about 50 percent, compared to electrical water heaters. Storage tank hot water heater have a higher initial cost than electrical.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
