<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
