<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But discovering the ideal washer may not be.

Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
