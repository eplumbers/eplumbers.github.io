You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
