<p>Water supplied by the public utility consists of some amounts of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenditures. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
