If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to among the other two kinds of salts. Once the new salt has actually had a possibility to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
