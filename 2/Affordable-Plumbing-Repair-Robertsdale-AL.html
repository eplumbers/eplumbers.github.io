<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
