<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
