It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
