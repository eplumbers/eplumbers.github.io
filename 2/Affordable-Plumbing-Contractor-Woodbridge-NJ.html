This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the yard above it to become soggy. You may smell the revolting smell of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it required to cordon off that part of your yard. Because the swampiness will attract unwanted creatures, the scenario is filled with problems.
