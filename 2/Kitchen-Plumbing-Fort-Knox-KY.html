<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
