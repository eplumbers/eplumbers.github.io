If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades prior to that, chances are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>
