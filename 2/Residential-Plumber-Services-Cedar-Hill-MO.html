<p>Whether you're a homeowner, company owner, or home manager, at some time you will probably need to call a plumber.

A bad plumber can be your worst headache in terms of issues that keep coming back to bite you.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
