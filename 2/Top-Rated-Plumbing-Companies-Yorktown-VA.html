<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches.

<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Yorktown VA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic style of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or fixed flow condition might trigger annoyance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
