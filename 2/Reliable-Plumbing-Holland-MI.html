Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
