Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
