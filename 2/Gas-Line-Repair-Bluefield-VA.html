<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
