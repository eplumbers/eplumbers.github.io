<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to determine if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which include liquids and gases. Applications vary from softening in remote locations to dealing with issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horse power, or HP. These correspond straight to how much waste the unit can handle, and recommended sizes are typically based upon the number of users are in a household.
