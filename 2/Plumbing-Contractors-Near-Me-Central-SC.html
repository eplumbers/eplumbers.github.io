<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling.
