<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke, however it's extremely serious if you want to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list. If you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a building task or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make last changes before inspection day. Failing an examination can suggest undesirable hold-ups in your task.</p>
