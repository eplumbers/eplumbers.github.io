<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
