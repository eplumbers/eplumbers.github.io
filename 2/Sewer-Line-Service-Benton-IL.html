Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
