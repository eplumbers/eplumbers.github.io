<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Riverdale IL</h3>
<p>Faulty plumbing and fixtures can be more than a problem: It can cost you cash in increased water bills and trigger structural damage to your home. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leaks in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Fixing those leakages can conserve you 10 percent on your water costs each year.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a really percentage of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low salt" by the Fda.</p>
