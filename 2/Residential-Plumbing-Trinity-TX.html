When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt way, the opportunities are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
