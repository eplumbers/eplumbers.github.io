<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
