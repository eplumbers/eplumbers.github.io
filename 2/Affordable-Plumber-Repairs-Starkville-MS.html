<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize more and more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
