<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional support. Continued efforts by yourself can damage your lines, and you may have a more severe underlying problem than you know. Additionally, the longer you delay to call for professional help, the greater the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
