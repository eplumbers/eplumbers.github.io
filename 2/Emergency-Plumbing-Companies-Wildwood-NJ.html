<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
