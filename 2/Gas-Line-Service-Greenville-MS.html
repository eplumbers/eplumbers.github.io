However, the majority of toilet repairs are basic and uncomplicated tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
