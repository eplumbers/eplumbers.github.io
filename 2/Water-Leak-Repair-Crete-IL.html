<p>Spotty dishes? Tankless Hot Water Heater: Tankless water heaters have actually become increasingly popular, since the water is only warmed when it's needed.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
