Copper is basic because it's lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is challenging to install, which means higher labor costs.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
