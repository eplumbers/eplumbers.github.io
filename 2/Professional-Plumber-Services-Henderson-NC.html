<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
