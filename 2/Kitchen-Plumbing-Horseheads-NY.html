While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
