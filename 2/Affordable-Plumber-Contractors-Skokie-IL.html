<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing.
