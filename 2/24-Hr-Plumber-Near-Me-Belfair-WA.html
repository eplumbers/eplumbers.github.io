They usually utilize sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While effective at eliminating obstructions, they could do your plumbing more harm than good. Here are 3 factors to prevent pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
