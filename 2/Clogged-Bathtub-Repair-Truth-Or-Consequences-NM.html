Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a building these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
