<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public supply of water and private on-site supply of water and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>
