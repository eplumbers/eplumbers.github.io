<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
