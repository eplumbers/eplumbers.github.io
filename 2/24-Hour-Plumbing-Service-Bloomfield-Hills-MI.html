Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements normally found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
