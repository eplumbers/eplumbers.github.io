<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.
