If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
