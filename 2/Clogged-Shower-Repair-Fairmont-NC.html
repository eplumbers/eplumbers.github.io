<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
