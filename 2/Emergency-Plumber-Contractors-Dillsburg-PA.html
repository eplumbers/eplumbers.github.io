<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace firmness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place?

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
