While sluggish draining implies the drain isn't totally clogged, there's still adequate buildup inside it to stop water and waste from going down simple.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
