<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
