<p>E.R. Services understands the value of maintaining the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.
