<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>
