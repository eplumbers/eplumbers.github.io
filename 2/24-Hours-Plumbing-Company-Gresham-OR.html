<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider.

As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
