<p>You are responsible for repairing or replacing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based upon the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly must fulfill the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>

As a locally owned and operated company, our clients delight in truthful guidance and safe, professional plumbing services carried out to code. Galvanized pipes lose their zinc covering, making them unhealthy.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>It is very important that all elements of your gas lines remain in great condition. The state of the pipe is very important. As is the connection to your appliance and equipment. If any of these are an issue, there is the potential for gas leaks and even fire. When a Notification of Correction" or Notice of Requirement" is provided, failure to remedy an installation or install and after that check a backflow assembly may lead to service disturbance or termination.</p>
