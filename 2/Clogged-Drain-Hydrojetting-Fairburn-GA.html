<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
