<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Leesville LA 71446</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
