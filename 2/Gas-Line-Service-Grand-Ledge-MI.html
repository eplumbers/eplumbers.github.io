<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Grand Ledge MI</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
