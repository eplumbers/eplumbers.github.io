<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
