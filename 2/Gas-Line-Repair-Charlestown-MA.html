<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you should just hire a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch wetness so that it doesn't go into the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>However, there is one Do It Yourself project that isn't basic and is best left to the experts: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can rapidly become complex when handled by someone with little to no experience in plumbing.
