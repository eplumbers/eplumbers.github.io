<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
