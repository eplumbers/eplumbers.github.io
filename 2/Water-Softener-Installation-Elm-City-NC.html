<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
