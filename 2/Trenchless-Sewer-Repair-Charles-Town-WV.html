If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
