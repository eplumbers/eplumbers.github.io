<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
