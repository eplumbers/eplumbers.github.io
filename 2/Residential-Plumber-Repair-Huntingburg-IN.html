<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Huntingburg IN</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
