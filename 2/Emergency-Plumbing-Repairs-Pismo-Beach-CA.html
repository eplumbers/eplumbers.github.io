You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
