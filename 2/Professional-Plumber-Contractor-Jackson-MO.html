<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an effect on detergent savings. The study included tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to assessing spotting and filming. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up in addition to water at 10 gpg solidity level. That detergent savings rises to nearly 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
