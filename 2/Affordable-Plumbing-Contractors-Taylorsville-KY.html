<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
