<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You should wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
