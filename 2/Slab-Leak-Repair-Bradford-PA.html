<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>

For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to stream backwards into city water supplies.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
