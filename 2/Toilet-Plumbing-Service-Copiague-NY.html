<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
