<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
