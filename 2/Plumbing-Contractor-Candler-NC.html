<p>Depending upon your situation, your plumber may use one or a mix of piping material during your home repiping job. Copper is standard because it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which means greater labor costs.

PEX also withstands rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your needs.</p>
