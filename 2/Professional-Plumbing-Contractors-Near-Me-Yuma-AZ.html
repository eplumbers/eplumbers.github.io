<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you ought to just work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
