Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
