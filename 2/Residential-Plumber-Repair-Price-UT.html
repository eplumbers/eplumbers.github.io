<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Though it's not always needed, sometimes the plumber may have to upgrade or repair wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This typically costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be blemished or degraded if the gas line is damaged. Contact our specialists to figure out the level of the problem.</p>
