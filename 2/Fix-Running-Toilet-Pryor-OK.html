<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is fairly new, you might need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
