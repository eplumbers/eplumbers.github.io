Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be treated with the best RO system.</p>
