<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Considering that 1998, we have been serving Southern California with industry-leading plumbing services varying from brand-new and redesign building jobs to installation and repair residential services. A lot of sink blockages that take place are much deeper than you may think, and the severity is so serious that a normal store-bought drain cleaner or impromptu home drain cleaning solution can not fix.</p>
