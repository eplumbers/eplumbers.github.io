<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a lifespan of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly kept. Making sure the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
