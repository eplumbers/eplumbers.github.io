<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old.
