<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
