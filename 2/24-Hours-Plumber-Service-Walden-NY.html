(Please obtain your sewer tap authorization( s) from MSD initially). If the problem is too bad to repair, there's also a possibility you'll have to replace your sink or faucet and install a new one. Installation costs for a brand-new sink or faucet are $75 - $210, plus the cost of the new sink or faucet.</p>
