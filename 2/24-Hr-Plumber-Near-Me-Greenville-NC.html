<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Greenville NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
