<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
