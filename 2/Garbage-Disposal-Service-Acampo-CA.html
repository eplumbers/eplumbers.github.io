<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
