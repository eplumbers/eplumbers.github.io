<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.

A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
