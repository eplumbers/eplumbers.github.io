<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
