Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
