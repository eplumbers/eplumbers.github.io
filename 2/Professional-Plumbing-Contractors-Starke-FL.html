<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are eliminated to attach the pipes to the water components, Wood says.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
