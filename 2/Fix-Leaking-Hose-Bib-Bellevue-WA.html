<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
