<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
