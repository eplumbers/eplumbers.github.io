Soft water feels noticeably smooth to the skin. It also makes your home simple to clean by reducing hard-water build-up.

<p>Often triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a defective fill valve may actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
