<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary material used in plumbing.

During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can end up being used and corroded, leading to leaks. Depending upon the intensity of the scenario, only one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and replaced. Elements involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
