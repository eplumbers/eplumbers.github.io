<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
