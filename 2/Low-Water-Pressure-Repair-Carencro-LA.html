<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
