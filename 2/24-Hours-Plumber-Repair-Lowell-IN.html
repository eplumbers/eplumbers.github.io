While repairs can fix a leak, it's often much better to buy a new toilet. A leak can go unnoticed, triggering damage to your subfloor. If you need toilet repairs or are seeking to install a new system, call 415-441-2255 and talk to Magic Plumbing. We can discover the solution you're looking for.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent style of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or static circulation condition might trigger nuisance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly.
