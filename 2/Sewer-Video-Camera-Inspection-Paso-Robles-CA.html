<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
