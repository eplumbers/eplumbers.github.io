<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains.

The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
