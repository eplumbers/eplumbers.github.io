<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractors in Ashland</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
