<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
