<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
