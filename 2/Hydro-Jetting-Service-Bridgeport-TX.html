Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
