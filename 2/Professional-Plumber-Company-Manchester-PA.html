<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
