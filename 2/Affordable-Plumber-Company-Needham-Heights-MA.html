<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
