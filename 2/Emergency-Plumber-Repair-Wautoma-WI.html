<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
