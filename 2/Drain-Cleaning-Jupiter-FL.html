<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow of water which may carry unclean water or other, dangerous substances into the general public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a variety of scenarios that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City supply of water lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing group gets the job done rapidly and affordably.</p>
