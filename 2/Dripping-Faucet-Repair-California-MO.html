A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly must be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is needed to ensure it was repaired properly. An effectively fixed assembly should provide years of security.</p>
