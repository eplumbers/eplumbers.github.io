<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage should not cause a water softener to leak.

You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low.

For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
