<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
