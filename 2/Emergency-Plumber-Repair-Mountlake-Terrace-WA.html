<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply.

<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly. Water softening can avoid these negative effects. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell frequently connected with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this unique fragrance permits you to smell a possible leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide 2 types of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
