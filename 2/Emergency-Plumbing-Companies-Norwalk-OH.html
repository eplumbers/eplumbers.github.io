<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<h3>Bathroom Faucet Repair in Norwalk Ohio</h2>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the community system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your home.</p>

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
