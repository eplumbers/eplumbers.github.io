<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair.

I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
