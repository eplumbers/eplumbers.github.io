<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
