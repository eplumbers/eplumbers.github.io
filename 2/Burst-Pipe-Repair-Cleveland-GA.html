Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to determine correct maintenance schedules or the degree of required repairs.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
