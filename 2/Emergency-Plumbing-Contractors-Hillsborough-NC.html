<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger substantial problems. Even small leakages can gradually moisten walls and floors up until they become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other allergens. Old galvanized iron pipes might end up being rusty and include rust to the water supply. Gurgling noise from pipes. An unusual, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a great sign. Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to address this problem. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
