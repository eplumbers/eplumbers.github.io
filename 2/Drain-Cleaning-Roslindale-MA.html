<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
<p>Typically the costs of a water softener can differ in between EUR 0,20 and EUR 0,40 a day.
