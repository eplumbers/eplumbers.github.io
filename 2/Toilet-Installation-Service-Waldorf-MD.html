<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into circumstances, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd like to post some pictures of this. Simply search line. The problem does exist.</p>

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
