<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
