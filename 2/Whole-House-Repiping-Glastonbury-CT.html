<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>The average cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending on the size and design. They are much safer to utilize than constant feed disposals, but are not advised for families that create a lot of food waste. Rather of a switch, the batch feed garbage disposal is triggered by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
