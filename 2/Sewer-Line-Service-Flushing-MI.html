After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
