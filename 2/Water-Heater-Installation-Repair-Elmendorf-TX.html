<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation appointment. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service.

<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Lots of sprinkling systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need only be tested each year. Others might not meet state and local regulations and might need to be changed with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
