<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being trapped between your drain and your pipes.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
