<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

Internal sources consist of the abovementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and devices such as dish washers, warm water tanks, glowing water heater, etc. External sources consist of rain water run-off from roofing systems and parking area, groundwater, puddles of surface area water, sanitary sewer pipelines, other supply of water pipelines, septic systems, underground storage tanks and cisterns, irrigation pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, lawn sprinklers, farming run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost piles, buried or aboveground chemical tank, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewage systems during heavy rains events into structure foundations and basements.</p>
