<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in fact, essential day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing flavor many people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is stated to be tough.</p>
