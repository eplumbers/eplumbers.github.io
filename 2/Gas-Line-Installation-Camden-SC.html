<p>Quality sinks effectively installed last for years, so we're usually called in for kitchen and bath remodels. However with stains or scratches in a kitchen sink along with chipped or broken porcelain in bathroom sinks numerous homeowners pick a sink installation alone. Sinks and components might likewise develop drain problems that require a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also include changing or replacing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
