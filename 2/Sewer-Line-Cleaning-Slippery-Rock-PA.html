<h3>Leaky Faucets in Slippery Rock PA 16057 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with difficult water, you may not realize just how much it affects you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
