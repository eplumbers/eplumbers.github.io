<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

Normally, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze.
