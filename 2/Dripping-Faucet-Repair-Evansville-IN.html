<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that locals are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be treated with the best RO system.</p>
