Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
