<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
