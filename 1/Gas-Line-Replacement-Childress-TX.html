<p>You reside in an older home. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
