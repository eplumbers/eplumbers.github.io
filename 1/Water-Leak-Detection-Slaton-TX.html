<p>Wondering just how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a lot of variables that might come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or slowly draining.

When a brand-new home is built, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed correctly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
