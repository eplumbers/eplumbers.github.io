<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
