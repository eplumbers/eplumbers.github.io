Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
