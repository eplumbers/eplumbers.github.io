<p>If you discover yourself constantly jiggling the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to contact one of our licensed Columbus plumbers to help you in finding the leak or broken part and fixing it.

<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home, this is one of the very first and main concerns that you should ask yourself. The age of your home is a critical component to understand whether you must repipe your home. This is not only since your plumbing has actually aged with time, but likewise due to the fact that houses that were developed before a certain time period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was built years prior to that, possibilities are that your home might need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimum rates.</p>
<p>If you discover low water pressure or discolored water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
