<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
