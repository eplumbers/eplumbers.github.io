<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning gadgets have been marketed based upon a range of claims regarding their effect on water hardness and associated scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not been able to identify requirements for these items and report inconsistent efficiency to date.
