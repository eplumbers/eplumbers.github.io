<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
