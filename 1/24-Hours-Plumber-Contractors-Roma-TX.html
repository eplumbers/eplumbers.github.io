While this may operate in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your house, implying that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>

<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more vulnerable and breakable to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure.
