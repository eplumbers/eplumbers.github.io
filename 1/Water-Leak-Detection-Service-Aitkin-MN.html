If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
