<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
