<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
