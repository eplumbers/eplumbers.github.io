Garbage disposals are quite easy to maintain. The most essential thing to bear in mind is that they are truly food disposals.

Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can hinder the blades. Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to make sure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>
