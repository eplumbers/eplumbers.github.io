<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building permit is generally needed before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften just what you need to.

Oftentimes, individuals select to soften just the warm water.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
