<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently because difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use increasingly more detergent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
