<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
