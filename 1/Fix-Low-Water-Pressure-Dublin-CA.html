<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
