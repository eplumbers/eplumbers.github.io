<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
