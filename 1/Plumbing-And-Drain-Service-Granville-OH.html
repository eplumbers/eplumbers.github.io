Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, particularly if you are handling a little drain clog. Nevertheless, they are usually short-lived fixes that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>
