<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
