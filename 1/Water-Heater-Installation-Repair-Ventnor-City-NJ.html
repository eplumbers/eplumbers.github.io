<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve becomes part of the system for that specific factor. But while small drips should not be cause for concern, property owners must watch on the hot water heater leaks. When we needed a leak in a pipe fixed, I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He likewise finished the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was less expensive than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
