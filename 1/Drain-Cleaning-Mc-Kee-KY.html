<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it comes to pipe repair, the most costly factors aren't the equipment or materials used, but the landscaping, lawn and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
