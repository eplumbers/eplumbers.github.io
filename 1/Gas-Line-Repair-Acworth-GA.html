<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
