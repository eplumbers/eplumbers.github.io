<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Shelton CT</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system might not just save customers money however could also be environmentally friendly, since it helps cut down on hazardous cleaning agents going into water streams.
