<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
