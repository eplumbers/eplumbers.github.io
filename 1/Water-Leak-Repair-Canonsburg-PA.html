When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.
