If you live in an earthquake-prone area, strap the hot water heater to the wall with special straps (Fig. A; readily available at plumbing shops and home centers). Your plumbing inspector will inform you if they're needed.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
