<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
