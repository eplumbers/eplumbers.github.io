<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
