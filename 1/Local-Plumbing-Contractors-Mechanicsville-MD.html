Difficult water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
