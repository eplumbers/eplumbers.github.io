<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
