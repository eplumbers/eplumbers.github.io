<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.
