The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
