<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Midlothian VA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very rare cases where the structure is considered to not posture a risk to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Was your home built before the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has actually worn away and rotted over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger major leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
