Drip legs catch moisture so that it does not go into the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system.
