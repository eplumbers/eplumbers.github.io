<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many individuals go for diy repairs. However sometimes even identifying the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
