<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In La Grange NC</h3>
<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible.
