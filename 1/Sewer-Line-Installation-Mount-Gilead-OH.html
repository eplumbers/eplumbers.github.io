<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
