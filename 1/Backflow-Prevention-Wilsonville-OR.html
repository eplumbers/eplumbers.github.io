<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the yard above it to become soggy. You might smell the horrible odor of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that portion of your yard. Due to the fact that the swampiness will attract undesirable creatures, the situation is laden with problems.
