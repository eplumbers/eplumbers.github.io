Whole-house repiping can definitely be a big undertaking, which is why the service is only performed when absolutely needed. First, your plumber will choose which piping product to use for the job, either copper or plastic. Replacing and installing new pipes can take anywhere in between 3-5 days depending on the size of your house.</p>
<p>If your disposal's installation will require a new mounting flange in the sink, you'll need to install that first. Remove it as discussed above if you're replacing an old disposer.
