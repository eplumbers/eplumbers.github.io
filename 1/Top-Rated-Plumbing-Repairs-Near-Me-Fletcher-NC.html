<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the unit). Each cycle will release 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you may not want simply running outside. Not to point out plumbing code may be broken without correct backflow prevention.</p>
