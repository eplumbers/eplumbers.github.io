Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
