<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

A basic manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
