<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.
