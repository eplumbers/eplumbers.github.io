<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
