<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
