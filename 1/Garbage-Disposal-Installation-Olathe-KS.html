<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as needed. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as preferred.</p>
<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, normally sodium. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a very percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
