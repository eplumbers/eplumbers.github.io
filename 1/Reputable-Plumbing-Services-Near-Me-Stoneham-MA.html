<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unnecessary clogs further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of contaminants and will need to be changed. (This need to not hold true if the resin is periodically regenerated and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
