<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are exceptionally important to developing a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water supply within a structure these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly basic system, regardless of their value. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your business, where irrigation meets the main water system.

This ensures that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>
