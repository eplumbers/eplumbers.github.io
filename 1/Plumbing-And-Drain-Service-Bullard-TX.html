<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you want to try the gentlest technique possibly attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and safety cautions first!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's easily offered at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
