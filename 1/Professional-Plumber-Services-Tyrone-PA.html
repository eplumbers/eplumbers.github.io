<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
