<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an effect on detergent cost savings. The study included tests that eliminated tough soils, in addition to examining recording and spotting. Scientists discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up in addition to water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings increases to almost 70%.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas.
