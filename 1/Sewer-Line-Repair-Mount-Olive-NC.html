<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
