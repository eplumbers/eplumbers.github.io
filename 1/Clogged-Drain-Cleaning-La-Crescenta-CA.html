<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>When set up, these BPAs go through initial and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational efficiency. Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester registered with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service.
