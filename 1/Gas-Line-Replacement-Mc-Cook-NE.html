Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the issue. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
