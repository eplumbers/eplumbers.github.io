If you presume a gas leak, first call your local energy company then call a plumber.

An energy company will detect if there is a gas leak, but they do not find the source of the leak or repair it.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
