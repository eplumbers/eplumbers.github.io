<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
