<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
