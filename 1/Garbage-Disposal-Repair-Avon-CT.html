It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your house, meaning that difficulty could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
