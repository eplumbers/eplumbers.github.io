<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
