He kept in mind that there are certain impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>
