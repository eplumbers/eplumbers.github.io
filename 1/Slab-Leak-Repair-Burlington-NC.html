<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and low-cost. But finding the best washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
