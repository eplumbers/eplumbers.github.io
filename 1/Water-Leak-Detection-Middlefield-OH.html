<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Frequently brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, too. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>If you've ever been irritated by cloudy white spots on your meals that will not disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a stubborn layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to know that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Hard water causes these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to fret about any problems with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes chores simpler and less frustrating for everybody included.</p>
