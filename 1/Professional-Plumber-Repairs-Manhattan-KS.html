<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Manhattan KS</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
