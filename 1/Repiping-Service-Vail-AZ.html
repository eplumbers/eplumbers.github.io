<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost techniques replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing blockages. They usually use sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to dissolve gunky build-up. While effective at getting rid of clogs, they might do your plumbing more damage than good. Here are 3 reasons to avoid pouring these harsh chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will generally vary from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required. If you're transforming your home to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, anticipate to invest $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line expenses include appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
