<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element.
