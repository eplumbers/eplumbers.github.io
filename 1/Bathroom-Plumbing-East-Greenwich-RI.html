<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It's important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and clogs - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain too. After completing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>The best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by setting up a pressure reducing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it enters into the house. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to conserve water as components in the home will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
