A hot water heater is basically a household home appliance that includes a gas or electrical heating unit under a tank in which water is heated up and kept.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
