<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
