<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is an innovation that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism frequently acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is accomplished with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally remove temporary solidity in water.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
