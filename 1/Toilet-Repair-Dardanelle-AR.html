<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
