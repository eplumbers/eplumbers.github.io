<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home.
