<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

If you're transforming your house to natural gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses consist of device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
