Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a durable and outstanding option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. The liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is utilized. Once the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
