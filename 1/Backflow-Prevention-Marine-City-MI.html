Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place?

The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
