<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual homes, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>Backpressure takes place when the pressure in a personal water supply surpasses the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can trigger regular flow to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, including toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
