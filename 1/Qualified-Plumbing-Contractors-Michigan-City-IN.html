<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.

<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>
