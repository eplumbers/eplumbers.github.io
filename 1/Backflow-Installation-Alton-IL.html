The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you choose need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse also brings a large selection of backflow prevention devices.
