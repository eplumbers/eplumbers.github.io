<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
