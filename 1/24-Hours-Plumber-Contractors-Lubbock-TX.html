Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
