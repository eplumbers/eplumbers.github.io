<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line.
