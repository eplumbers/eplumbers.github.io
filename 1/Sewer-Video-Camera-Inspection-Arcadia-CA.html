<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
