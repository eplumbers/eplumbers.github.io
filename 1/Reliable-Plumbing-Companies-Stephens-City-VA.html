<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
