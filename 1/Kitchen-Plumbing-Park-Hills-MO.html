<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal.

(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
