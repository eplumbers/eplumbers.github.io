You may be thinking that it does not make good sense to utilize a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be proper.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
