<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to see what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause blockages and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
