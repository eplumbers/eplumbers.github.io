<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
