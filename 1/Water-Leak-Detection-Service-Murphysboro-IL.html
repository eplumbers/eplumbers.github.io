Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You must likewise examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
