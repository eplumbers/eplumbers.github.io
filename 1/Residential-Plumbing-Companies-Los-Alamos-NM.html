<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
