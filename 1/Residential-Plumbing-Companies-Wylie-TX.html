It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
