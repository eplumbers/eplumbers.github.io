<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams easily from the sink drain into your bucket, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your house can damage floorings, carpentry, and other important things such as cabinets.

<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "hard" depends on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in truth, necessary day-to-day nutrients.

Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is stated to be tough.</p>

You might end up doing more damage than great if you continue to battle with it, which can produce irreversible problems. Sewage back-flow is another significant issue if you do not have a professional look into your clog situation.</p>
