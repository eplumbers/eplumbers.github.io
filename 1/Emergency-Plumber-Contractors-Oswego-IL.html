<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both.
