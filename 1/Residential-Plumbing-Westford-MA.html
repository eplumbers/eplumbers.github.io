Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter situations, on a regular basis that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd enjoy to post some images of this. Just search line. The issue does exist.</p>
<h3>Blocked Sink in Westford Massachusetts</h2>
