The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.
