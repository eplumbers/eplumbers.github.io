<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
