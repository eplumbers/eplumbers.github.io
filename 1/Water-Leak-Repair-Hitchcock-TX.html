<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
