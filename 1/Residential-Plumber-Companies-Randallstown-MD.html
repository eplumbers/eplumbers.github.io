<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
