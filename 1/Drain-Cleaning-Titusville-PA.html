<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
