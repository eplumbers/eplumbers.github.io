<p>While tankless heater are advantageous in particular areas, they also have some potential downsides as well. In a tankless, heat is generated in a bottom up fashion. Cold water travels through a series of coils that minimize water pressure in order to heat water rapidly. However, the coils may clog up over time with scale accumulation that lowers effectiveness, and might ultimately trigger the heat exchanger to there is a new system that does all it guarantees and more. It's called Hybrid Water Heating. A Hybrid Hot water heater pushes cold water from the bottom up through a series of radiating transfer pipes.
