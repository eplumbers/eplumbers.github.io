<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
