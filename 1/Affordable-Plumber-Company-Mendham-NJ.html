<p>Water temperature level concerns can be fixed by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
