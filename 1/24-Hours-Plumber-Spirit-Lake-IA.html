<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
