<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  location.
