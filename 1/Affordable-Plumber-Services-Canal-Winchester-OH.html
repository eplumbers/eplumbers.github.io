Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
