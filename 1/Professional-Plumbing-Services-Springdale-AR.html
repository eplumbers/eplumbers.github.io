<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
