Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
