<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
