<p>Very first consider your choices if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be essential. Often, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a lot of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Plan to replace the water heater right away if you identify a drip. Don't wait up until the leak gets bad.

Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
