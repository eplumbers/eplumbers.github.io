<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank.
