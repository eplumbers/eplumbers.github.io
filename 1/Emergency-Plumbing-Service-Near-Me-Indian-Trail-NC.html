An entirely various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
