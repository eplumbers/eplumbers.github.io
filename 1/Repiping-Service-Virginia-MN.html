<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
