<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more fragile and susceptible to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and pressures as a result of temperature change and ice formation.
