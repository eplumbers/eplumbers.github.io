<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use a growing number of detergent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regeneration. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
