<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Somers Point</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Today, most professionals recommend a cautious inspection of residential water heaters regularly - at least annually. Malfunctioning hot water heater cause a range of problems. These issues run the range from unreliable or slow water heating to expensive water leakages and potential fire threats.
