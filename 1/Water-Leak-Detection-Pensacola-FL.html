<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Pensacola FL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
