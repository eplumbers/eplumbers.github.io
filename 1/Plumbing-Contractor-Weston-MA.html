Water softeners usually utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are supplied from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called brine.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>For instance, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and needing repair, a new unit will save you money. Furthermore, if you see rising energy costs from an inefficient system, you will also conserve money with a brand-new installation. We advise that all hot water heater that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to conserve the homeowner money and time in the future.</p>
