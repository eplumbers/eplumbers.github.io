<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
