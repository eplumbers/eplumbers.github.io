<p>You reside in an older home. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
