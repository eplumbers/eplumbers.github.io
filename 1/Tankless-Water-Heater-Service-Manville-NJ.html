Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
