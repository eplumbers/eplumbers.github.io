<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).
