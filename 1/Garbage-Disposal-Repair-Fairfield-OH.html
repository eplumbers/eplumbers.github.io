<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
