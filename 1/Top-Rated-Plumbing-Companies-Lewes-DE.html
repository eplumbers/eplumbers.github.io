<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Lewes DE 19958</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will determine the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
