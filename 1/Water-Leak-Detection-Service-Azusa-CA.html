<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

Although this is not the only method to end up being competent within the industry, the majority of plumbers use this strategy to find out the required abilities to end up being successful in the trade. Usually, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>
