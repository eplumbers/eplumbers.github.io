Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are typically short-term fixes that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
