<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Baton Rouge LA 70816</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to obstructions that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>

Water will always stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
