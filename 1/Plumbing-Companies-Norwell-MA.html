<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
