Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
