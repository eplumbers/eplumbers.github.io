<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might utilize one or a mix of piping product during your house repiping task. Copper is standard because it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which means higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which implies plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves time and money and reduces the threat of joint leaks. PEX likewise resists deterioration and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>

<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
