<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
