<p>In fact, that's how hard water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves.

When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to see gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or unusual smells. Drain blockages are caused by wear and tear or an accumulation of things we put down the drain over time and as we know, they can trigger major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up prior to it leads to additional damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>
