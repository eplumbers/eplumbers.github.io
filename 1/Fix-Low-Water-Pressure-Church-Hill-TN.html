<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
