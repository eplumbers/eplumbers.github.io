It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to allow others to examine them and to verify the outcomes. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one hesitate to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>
