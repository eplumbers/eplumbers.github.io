<p>The toilet is leaking. You have a leak if you hear your toilet running consistently or observe water pooling around the base. While repairs can fix a leak, it's often much better to invest in a new toilet. A leak can go unnoticed, triggering damage to your subfloor. Call 415-441-2255 and speak to Magic Plumbing if you need toilet repairs or are looking to install a brand-new unit. We can find the solution you're looking for.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will send the results to us. If you need a garbage disposal replacement, make certain to discover a plumber you trust who will finish the job right at a reasonable cost.</p>
