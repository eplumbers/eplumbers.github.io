<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Philadelphia PA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
