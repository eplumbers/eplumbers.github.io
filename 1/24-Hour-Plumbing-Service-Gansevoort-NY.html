<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Gansevoort NY</h3>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to the end of the water main. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they used to be. These days, homeowners can pick from an excessive variety of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is generally a sign of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the clog isn't removed, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually causing it to burst.</p>
