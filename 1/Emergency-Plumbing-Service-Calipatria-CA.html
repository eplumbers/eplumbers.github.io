When drains are working correctly that's truly all you need to understand about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
