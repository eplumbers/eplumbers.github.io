<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Smyrna DE</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not present a danger to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
