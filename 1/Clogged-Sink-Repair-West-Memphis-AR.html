Houses integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards connected with lead.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection in between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a private water supply exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger regular circulation to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be performed on all drains, including toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
