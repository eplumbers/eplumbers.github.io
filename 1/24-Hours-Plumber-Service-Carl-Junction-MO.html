The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.

<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Carl Junction MO</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
