Exemptions, which are given in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is considered to not position a risk to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
