<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
