<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and steady  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
