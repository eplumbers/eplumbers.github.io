Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
