<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
