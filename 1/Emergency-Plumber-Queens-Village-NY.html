<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most building contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification.

This will substantially reduce the amount of salt in your diet and save you money by not softening water unnecessarily.</p>
