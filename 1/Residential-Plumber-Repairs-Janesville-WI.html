<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system.

<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides better, safer drinking water.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by aligning it.

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard.
