<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>

Furthermore, if you see increasing energy costs from an inefficient unit, you will also save money with a brand-new installation. We suggest that all hot water heater that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to conserve the homeowner money and time in the future.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
