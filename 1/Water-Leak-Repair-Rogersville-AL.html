<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively new.

Examine the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
