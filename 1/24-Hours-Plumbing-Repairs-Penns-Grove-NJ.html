<p>A plumbing floor plan (strategy view) or partial floor plan indicating water services, name and address of center, water meter layout, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all nearby objects (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, etc.). The plan should be drawn to scale or with dimensions indicated from walls and all neighboring things.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can take place in time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
