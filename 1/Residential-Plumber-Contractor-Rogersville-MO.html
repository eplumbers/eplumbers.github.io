<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
