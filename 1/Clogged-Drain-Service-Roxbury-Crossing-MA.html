<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and readily available for use.
