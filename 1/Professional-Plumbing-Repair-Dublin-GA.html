<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
