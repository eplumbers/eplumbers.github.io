<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Greenville NC</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
