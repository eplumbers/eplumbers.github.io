We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>
