<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Elkton MD</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
