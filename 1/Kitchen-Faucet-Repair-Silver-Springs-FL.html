When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>However, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to accomplish the very same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are added to a fire protection system supplied by a safe and clean water supply, increased defense is also needed.
