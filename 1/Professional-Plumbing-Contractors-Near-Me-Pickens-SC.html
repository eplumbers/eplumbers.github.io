<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
