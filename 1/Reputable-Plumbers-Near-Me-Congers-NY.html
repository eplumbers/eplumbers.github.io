<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
