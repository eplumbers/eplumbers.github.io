Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
