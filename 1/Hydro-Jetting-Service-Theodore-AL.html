In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.
