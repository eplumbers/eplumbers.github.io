<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high price makes it impractical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in some cases, consist of phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>

<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals referred to as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually correct, a sink waste disposal system."
