<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
