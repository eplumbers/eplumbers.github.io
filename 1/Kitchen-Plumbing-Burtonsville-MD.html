<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
