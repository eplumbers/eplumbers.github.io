Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
