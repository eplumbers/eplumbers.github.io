<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
