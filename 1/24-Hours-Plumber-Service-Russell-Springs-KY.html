<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
