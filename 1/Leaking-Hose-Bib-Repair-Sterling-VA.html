Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
