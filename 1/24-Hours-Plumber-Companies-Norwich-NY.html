<p>Many toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, don't require fixing the whole toilet. Like any house device, a toilet tank includes numerous little moving parts that might need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographical areas with corrosive water impurities.</p>
