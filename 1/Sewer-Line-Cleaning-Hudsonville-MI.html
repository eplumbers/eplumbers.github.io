Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
