<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger normal flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
