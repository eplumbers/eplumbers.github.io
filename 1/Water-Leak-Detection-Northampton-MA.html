<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
