<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water system and distribution pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for brand-new building residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly expensive, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also very long lasting and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely utilized pipe product for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
