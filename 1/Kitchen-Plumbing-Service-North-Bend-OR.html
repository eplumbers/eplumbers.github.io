Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
