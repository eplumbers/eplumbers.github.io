<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
