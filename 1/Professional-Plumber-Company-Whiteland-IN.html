<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
