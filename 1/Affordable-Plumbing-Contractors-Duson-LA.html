<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop.

After completing cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
