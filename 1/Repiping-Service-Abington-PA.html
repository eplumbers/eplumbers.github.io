Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Abington PA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
