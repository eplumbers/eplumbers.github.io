<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more pricey to repipe since the plumber will have to navigate through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a big job - and it's a task you wish to solve. However the variety of plumbing pipe products to pick from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at a few of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you pick the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
