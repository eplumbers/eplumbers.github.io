<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Because they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
