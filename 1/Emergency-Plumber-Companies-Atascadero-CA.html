For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
