<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline.
