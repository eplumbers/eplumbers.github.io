<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly.

You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
