<p>Recommendations: A knowledgeable plumbing company ought to be able to offer you the names of recent clients in your part of town. It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to find and total basic repairs, so consider that with the cost when trying to deal with the problem on your own. The reason a toilet will not flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause.
