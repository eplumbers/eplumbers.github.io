These chemicals are easy to utilize and economical, however they damage your pipes and their results are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak points that are vulnerable to burst.
