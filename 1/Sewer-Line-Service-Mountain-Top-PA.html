<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
