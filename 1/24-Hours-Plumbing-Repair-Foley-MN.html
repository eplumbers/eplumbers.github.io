<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
