<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides much better, more secure drinking water.

<p>After you've set up the unit, put a. stopper in the drain and fill the sink up with an inch of water. Examine below for any indications of leakages.

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
