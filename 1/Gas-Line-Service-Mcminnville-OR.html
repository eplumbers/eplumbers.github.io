<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Mcminnville OR</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
