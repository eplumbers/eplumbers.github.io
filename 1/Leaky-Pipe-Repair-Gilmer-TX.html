<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>

<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
