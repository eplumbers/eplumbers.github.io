<p>106.2.2.3 Repairs to Gas Piping. Repairs to gas piping will not be exempt work and will require a license and inspection. Some units run from a lightswitch, while others utilize a push button switch installed 1 close by. They cost approximately $100 for the whole system, and can be mounted 1 on the counter, sink, or cabinet for convenience. Hydro-jets: Having your drains hydro jetted can be an important tool in keeping problem drains under control.
