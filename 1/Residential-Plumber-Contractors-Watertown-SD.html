<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair.

The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
