<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent performance of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure involves covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and corrosion within the line.
