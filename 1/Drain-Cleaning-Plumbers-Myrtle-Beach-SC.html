<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job since of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
