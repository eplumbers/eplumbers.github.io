<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

Improperly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
