It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
