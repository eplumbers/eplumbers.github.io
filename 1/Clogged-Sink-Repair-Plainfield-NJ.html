<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes finishing Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the product and the pipe flowing through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check although it might be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
