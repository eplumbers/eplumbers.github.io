<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
